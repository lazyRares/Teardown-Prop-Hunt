# Teardown-Prop-Hunt
This program will randomly give you Images of 5 props from Teardown, you can choose to either play the "Traditional" style or come up with your own way. Great between friends.

## How Do You Use It?

Run the program from the "**Prop Hunt Teardown\bin\Debug\net6.0**" Folder, where the "**Prop Hunt Teardown.exe**" is located. Once you run the EXE once, it will generate 
the **prophunted.html** file in the bin folder. Opening this webpage will show you the 5 props. You can run the EXE and refresh the page as many times as you want to re-spin.

From there on you can play how you want, traditionally as we've been doing in the Teardown discord, where you have to go find the prop in game, But this way is more fun between friends then solo.
OR you can play however you'd like, something as simple as guessing the map.
